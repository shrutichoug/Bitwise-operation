# Bitwise-operation

In the arithmetic-logic unit (which is within the CPU), mathematical operations like: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are done in bit-level. To perform bit-level operations in C programming, bitwise operators are used.

Bitwise AND Operator &
The output of bitwise AND is 1 if the corresponding bits of two operands is 1. If either bit of an operand is 0, the result of corresponding bit is evaluated to 0.

In C Programming, the bitwise AND operator is denoted by &.

Bitwise OR Operator |
The output of bitwise OR is 1 if at least one corresponding bit of two operands is 1. In C Programming, bitwise OR operator is denoted by |.

Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) Operator ^
The result of bitwise XOR operator is 1 if the corresponding bits of two operands are opposite. It is denoted by ^.

Bitwise algorithms
The Bitwise Algorithms perform operations at the bit level or control bits in various ways. The bitwise algorithms are viewed as a lot quicker and are once in a while used to work on the effectiveness of a program. For instance: To check on the off chance that a number is even or odd. This can be handily finished by utilizing Bitwise-AND(&) administrator. Assuming the last bit of the administrator is set, then it is ODD; in any case, it is EVEN. Hence, if num and 1 are not equivalents to zero, then num is ODD; in any case, it is EVEN.

Every one of the information it gets is encoded at the most minimal level to a progression of zeros and ones. (0 and 1), and this is the primary way it figures out any order it's given. This series of 0 and 1 are known as bits.
